Changelog
=========

May 1, 2014
 
* Fixed the issue with the size of the blog title by moving it from the sidebar to a glorious new header. This gives the theme much more breathing room.
* Redesigned menu
* Licensing: Added proper licensing information for all the intellectual property I used while making Counterpoint. Script licensing can be found in line. Image licensing is in the readme-images.txt file in /counterpoint/images.
* functions.php: Added translation-ready function (http://dukeo.com/how-to-make-your-wordpress-theme-translation-ready/)
* header.php: Removed extra wp_enqueue_script('comment-reply')
